# Balancing Chemical Equations - Release Notes
<!-- Developer and designer should collaborate on what to include for any release beyond 1.0.0. 
For a 1.0.0 release, only the 1.0.0 heading and date is needed. 
When new releases occur, add the section below to the top of the doc. -->

## 2.0 (2025-XX-XX)

### New Features:
* New _Equations_ screen added,  containing 12 unbalanced equations representing synthesis, decomposition, and combustion reactions.
* New preference to set the initial coefficient for all equations. See _Preferences > Simulation > Initial Coefficient_.
* PhET-iO support, including PhET Studio.

### Changes:
* The "Tools" combo box has been re-titled "View", because these are not tools, they are alternative views (visual representations) of the selected equation.
* Balance Scales and Bar Charts views are now displayed vertically, rather than horizontally, because the horizontal layout was confusing.
* "Particles" view (Reactants & Products accordion boxes) has been added to the View combobox.   This is now a view that you select, rather than being visible all the time.
* All views (choices in the View combo box) are now mutually exclusive. Unlike the 1.X version, you cannot (for example) show Particles view and Balance Scales view at the same time. This was a compromise in order to make the Equations screen feasible (due to limited screen space) and to make the Balance Scales and Bar Charts views more usable by displaying them vertically.
* Balance Scales and Bar Charts will now highlight (turn yellow) individually when they are balanced. In previous versions, they did not highlight until the entire equation was balanced.
* The _Intro_ screen now shows the smiley face in the upper-left corner of the screen, rather than at top-center.  This change is to accommodate the new vertical layout of Balance Scales and Bar Charts views. A green checkmark with "Balanced" was also added. 
* Feedback in the _Game_ screen has been improved for balanced equations. In addition to telling the student that the equation is "Balanced", it also indicates whether the equation is "Simplified" (balanced with the smallest integer coefficients) or "Not Simplified". 

## 1.3 (2024-11-15)
